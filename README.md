# SRE-Onboarding
Broad collection of learning plan to getting up to speed as a Site Reliability Engineer.  This is highly opinionated due to my sample size of me.  I plan to cover the things I wish I knew and the things I want my new hires to know.  

## External Sites
* Get a [Linux Academy](https://linuxAcademy.com) subscription.  Besides it's focus on learning linux it provides several guided training plans for mastering many of the technologies and concepts you'll need.  Curated and consistent quality videos that walk you through far enough to then learn on your own.

* Peruse and then re-read the [Google SRE books](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/).  There are some concepts that only really become crystalline once you've had a few near misses.

* [Brendan Gregg's](http://www.brendangregg.com/overview.html) is a dense bit of knowledge to read but you will live or die by mastering what's in it.  Yes his focus is on linux debugging but his approach highlights a methodical and evidence based approach that you will do well to emulate
